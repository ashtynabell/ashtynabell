☝🏾Shoutout to [Steve Wallah](https://unsplash.com/@stevewallah) for capturing and sharing this beautiful photo. It inspires me every day.

## What up, doe. 🤜🏾💥🤛🏾
Maru naam Ashtyn che. I mostly write in [Swift](https://github.com/topics/swift) and [JavaScript](https://github.com/topics/javascript) while handling data in NoSQL databases, preferably [MongoDB](https://github.com/topics/mongodb). I build web + iOS products for [Greenbook](https://github.com/greenbook) and manage web & iOS products for [Rocketmiles](https://github.com/rocketmiles). Small talk with me for hours about `cultural exposure`, `hip hop`, `agricultural logistics with UAVs`, and `economic mobility`.


## ✈️ C:\the_world™ 🌍
Explore cities. Experience culture. When I'm in the States, you'll find me between Chicago and Oakland. When outside the States, ain't no tellin'.

```
let cities = {
  visited: 288,
  lived_in: 7,
  favorite: "Jerez de la Frontera"
};

let countries = {
  visited: 57,
  lived_in: 5,
  favorite: "Japan"
};

let continents = {
  visited: 6,
  lived_on: 3,
  favorite: "Africa"
};
```

## Interwebs 👨🏾‍💻
I'm `@ashtynabell` across most platforms, but sometimes `@ashtyn`. There's no rhyme or reason, just plain old inconsistency. 🙄
